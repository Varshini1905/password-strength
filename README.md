# PASSWORD STRENGTH

## Introduction
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to create strong passwords, evaluate their strength, and understand the importance of password complexity in securing your digital assets.

## 1. Password Creation

### Steps to Create Passwords
1. **Choose a Base**: Start with a phrase or a combination of words that are meaningful to you but not easily guessable.
2. **Add Complexity**: Incorporate uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
3. **Ensure Length**: Aim for at least 12–16 characters.

### Example Passwords

| Password Example                | Strength Level     |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| `password123`                  | Simple             |
| `Passw0rd!`                    | Moderate           |
| `G3n3r@t3dP@ssw0rd!2023`       | Complex            |
| `!Q2w#E4r%T6y^U8i*O0p(1)`      | Very Complex       |

## 2. Password Characteristics

| Character Type    | Examples                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Uppercase Letters** | A, B, C, D, E, F...        |
| **Lowercase Letters** | a, b, c, d, e, f...        |
| **Numbers**           | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...        |
| **Symbols**           | !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *...  |

### Example Evaluation Table

| Password                     | Score | Feedback                          |
|-----------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------|
| `password123`               | 10    | Too common, use more complexity. |
| `Passw0rd!`                 | 30    | Better, but still predictable.   |
| `G3n3r@t3dP@ssw0rd!2023`    | 70    | Strong, good mix of characters.  |
| `!Q2w#E4r%T6y^U8i*O0p(1)`   | 90    | Very strong, excellent complexity.|

## 4. Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- **Length**: Aim for at least 12–16 characters.
- **Complexity**: Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **Unpredictability**: Avoid using personal or common info like birthdays or names.
- **Unique Passwords**: Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts.
- **Use a Password Manager**: Securely generate and store complex passwords.

### Recommended Password Managers

| Password Manager | Website                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| LastPass         | https://www.lastpass.com        |
| 1Password        | https://1password.com           |
| Bitwarden        | https://bitwarden.com           |

## 5. Tips Learned from Evaluation

- Always include a **variety** of character types.
- **Longer** passwords are generally more secure.
- Avoid using **easily guessable** information.
- **Update** passwords regularly and avoid reusing them.

## 6. Common Password Attacks

| Type of Attack     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries every possible character combination until the correct one is found.  |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses a predefined list of common words and phrases to guess passwords.     |

---

## 7. Summary of Password Complexity and Security

Password complexity significantly affects security. A complex password is:

- Harder to guess.
- More resistant to brute force or dictionary attacks.
- Stronger due to length and variety of characters.

**Key Takeaway**: The more varied the characters and the longer the password, the more difficult it is for attackers to crack.

## Visual Aids (Suggested Additions)

We can also use visual aids to deepen our understanding towards what might be a strong password and what might not be, the following are some of the suggestions:

1. **Password Strength Meter**  
   A graphic showing password strength ranging from weak to strong.
2. **Strong vs. Weak Passwords Comparison Chart**  
   Side-by-side examples of poor and strong passwords.
3. **Password Creation Flowchart**  
   A visual guide to walk through the process of making a secure password.

## Conclusion

By following the best practices outlined in this guide and understanding the risks associated with weak passwords, you can improve your overall digital security. Make it a habit to:

- Regularly review your password habits.
- Avoid reuse.
- Rely on password managers for enhanced safety.

Stay secure in an ever-evolving digital world!
