# Common Password Attacks

## 1. Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

### Characteristics:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Attempts all combinations of characters.
- **Time-Consuming**: The time to crack depends on password length and complexity.
- **Tools Used**: Automated tools and scripts are often employed.

### Prevention:
- Use long, complex passwords.
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts.
- Use CAPTCHA to block automated attacks.

## 2. Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses a list of common words or phrases to guess passwords.

### Characteristics:
- **Word List**: Compiled from common passwords and previous breaches.
- **Faster than Brute Force**: Targets known words, making it quicker against weak passwords.
- **Targeting Weak Passwords**: Many users choose simple passwords.

### Prevention:
- Avoid common words or phrases.
- Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Regularly update and avoid reusing passwords.

## 3. Password Spraying
Password spraying is a variant of brute force where attackers try a few common passwords across many accounts.

### Characteristics:
- **Low and Slow**: Attempts to avoid detection by limiting the number of attempts per account.
- **Targets Common Passwords**: Uses widely known passwords like "123456" or "password".

### Prevention:
- Implement account lockout policies.
- Monitor for unusual login attempts.

## 4. Credential Stuffing
Credential stuffing involves using stolen username/password pairs from one service to gain access to accounts on other services.

### Characteristics:
- **Automated Attacks**: Often performed using bots.
- **Exploits Reused Passwords**: Many users reuse passwords across multiple sites.

### Prevention:
- Encourage unique passwords for different accounts.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## 5. Keylogging
Keylogging is a method where attackers use software or hardware to record keystrokes made by a user.

### Characteristics:
- **Stealthy**: Often runs in the background without user knowledge.
- **Targets All Input**: Can capture passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information.

### Prevention:
- Use anti-keylogging software.
- Regularly update and patch systems to close vulnerabilities.

## 6. Phishing
Phishing attacks trick users into providing their credentials by masquerading as a legitimate entity.

### Characteristics:
- **Social Engineering**: Relies on manipulating users into revealing sensitive information.
- **Variety of Forms**: Can be via email, SMS, or fake websites.

### Prevention:
- Educate users about recognizing phishing attempts.
- Implement email filtering and verification systems.

## Conclusion
Understanding these common password attacks is crucial for enhancing security. Users should adopt strong password practices and stay informed about evolving threats.
