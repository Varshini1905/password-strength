## Summary

- Simple passwords like `password` score very low and are evaluated as weak.  
- Adding uppercase letters improves the score but may still be insufficient.  
- Including numbers increases strength considerably.  
- Adding symbols further improves complexity and score.  
- Passphrases with a good mix of character types can reach the maximum score but watch out for repetitions.  
- Highly randomized passwords with varied characters achieve the strongest score.

This evaluation highlights the importance of creating long, complex, and unique passwords to maximize security.
